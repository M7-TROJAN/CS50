# CS50 Problem Sets and Code Solutions

Welcome to my CS50 journey! This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets and projects from Harvard University's [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) course. CS50 is an introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming, and I'm excited to share my work with you.

## About CS50

CS50 is a legendary course that has introduced countless students to the world of programming and computer science. It covers a wide range of topics, from the basics of programming in C to more advanced concepts like web development, databases, and even game development.

## Repository Structure

Each problem set and project is organized into its own folder, containing the problem statement, my solution, and any additional resources or notes that I found useful while working on it.
